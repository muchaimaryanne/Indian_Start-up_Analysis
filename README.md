# Indian_Start-up_Analysis

This project is work done by team Gstaad as we ventured into analyzing the Indian start-up market and sought to reject or fail to reject our null hypothesis.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to gather facts before venturing into the Indian Start-up market and provide insights.


### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Univariate Data Analysis
* Multi Variate Data Analysis
* Data Visualization


### Technologies
* Numpy
* Python
* Pandas
* jupyter
* Matplot lib
* JavaScript
* Seaborn

## Project Description

We used data on start-ups from the year 2018,2019,2020 and 2021. The data was cleaned and explored as different data sets that were later combined into one. Some of the problems discovered during EDA were:
1. The prescence of different currencies i.e Rupies and Dollars
2. Missing values  
3. Misplaced values.
After cleaning we used matplot lib to visualize our findings and present them using different graphs.

## Needs of this project


- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- writeup/reporting


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://github.com/muchaimaryanne/Indian_Start-up_Analysis/blob/main/India%20Startup%20Funding.zip) within this repo.

     
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/muchaimaryanne/Indian_Start-up_Analysis/blob/main/Funding%20Analysis.ipynb)
